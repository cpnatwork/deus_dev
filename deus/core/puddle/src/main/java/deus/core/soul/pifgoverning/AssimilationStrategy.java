 * Implementations of this strategy realize different update semantics, when a digital card for a given
 * FIF is received.
 * 
 * Two different scenarios can be distinguised:
 * 1. The received DC is new, so no DC with the same primary key is contained in the FIF
 * 2. There is already a DC with the primary key of the received DC. A kind of merge must be implemented
 * (e.g. either a simple replace, or an append, or a merge, or more complex versioning)
